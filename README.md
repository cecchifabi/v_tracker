## Running the application

In order to run this application, you will need the permissions to:

* access to the location
* access to accelerometer
* access to the camera

Also, you will need to create an account (can use fake data).

The QR codes to chance the status from healthy to infected (and vice versa)
are in the main folder of the project.

We suggest to run the app on a real device rather than on an emulator.
However, if you want to use the emulator, you can add the pictures of 
the QR codes in the virtual scene for the camera and simulate a route
using the .gpx file in the project folder. But you should be aware that
the device is not going to send any position to the database if the accelerometer
doesn't capture a sufficent movement, so probably from the emulator you 
could have problems.
