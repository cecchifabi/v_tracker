## Running the application

In order to run this application, you will need the permissions to:

* access to the location
* access to accelerometer
* access to the camera

Also, you will need to create an account (can use fake data).

The QR codes to change the status from healthy to infected (and vice versa)
are in the root folder of this repository.

We suggest to run the app on a real device rather than on an emulator.
However, if you want to use the emulator, you can add the pictures of 
the QR codes in the virtual scene for the camera and simulate a route
using the demoroute.gpx file in the project folder. Remember that you
can see the last location of infected users only if it's more recent than
4 days.
