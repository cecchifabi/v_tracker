## Running the application

In order to run this application, you will need the permissions to:

* access to the location
* access to accelerometer
* access to the camera

Also, you will need to create an account (can use fake data).

The QR codes to chance the status from healthy to infected (and vice versa)
are in the main folder of the project.

We suggest to run the app on a real device rather than on an emulator.
